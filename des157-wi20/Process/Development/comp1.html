            <p>This design comp shows what a new user would see upon arriving at the site for the first time. I tried to make it very simple and clean, but also friendly and inviting. Since the target audience is younger people who are probably more aesthetics-oriented, I am making an effort to walk the line between simplicity and invitingness. Thus, I made sure that none of my colors are too harsh.</p>
