        <p>After giving it a lot of thought, issues of education strike me as the most interesting, useful, and abundant of the topics discussed in class. I think that there are many educational websites and games created, designed to “make learning fun,” but these things always seems to come off as disingenuous and boring to me. I personally find exploring possibilities for my future and my personal growth to be much more motivating than playing educational games. Therefore, I approached the brainstorm from this perspective.<br></p>
        <p>Throughout the process I found myself picturing other directions that I could take the topic in and how I could explore intersections between education and other interests of mine. I was actually surprised at the ideas that were arising as I wrote things down. I’m thinking about maybe building a resource of some sort to help young people learn about themselves and perhaps suggest broad areas of study such as STEM, humanities, etc., based on personality traits, and with explanations to support the results. If I go with this, I’ll also try to have a way to show how far a test taker leans toward each field so as not to make things seem black and white.</p>
