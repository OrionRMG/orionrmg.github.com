                    <p>I found research on the topic of community to be very interesting. The psychology behind anonymous social interactions is something that I wanted to explore in depth so that I could create a casual social platform for good. From the TED talk, I learned that people are much more affected by the actions and behaviors of those around them than we may have otherwise expected. It is explained in the talk that there are three main causes of clustering of characteristics in social networks (i.e. people commonly knowing people who share certain characteristics). One is that one individual will cause another to have a characteristic, one is that individuals with a certain characteristic will connect with each other because of that commonality, and one is that some external factor that they share is creating the characteristic in each of them. The mechanism that I find fascinating is the one underlying the first cause: people causing others to adopt a characteristic. It seems that the reason someone adopts a characteristic of someone close to them is because one person normalizes a behavior, transmitting that idea to another person. This then changes that other person’s mindset and therefore their behavior. I think that this information is very pertinent and useful for my project idea.</p>
                    <p>I also learned, from Joe Dawson’s article, that while people are more likely to act aggressively when they are anonymous, they will also open up more easily and freely help others because they feel that the other person won’t be embarrassed, since they aren’t in public. According to Dawson, whether an anonymous group behaves negatively or positively is determined by the established norms of the group. By this he means that if the group members perceive the group to be a positive space, they will unconsciously work to maintain that state and will behave helpfully towards each other. Conversely, if the initial state of the group is violent or negative, all of the members will be more likely to behave respectively. It should also be noted that a study found that the mere fact that an interaction is digital can also encourage sharing, without the need for complete anonymity. For example, they found that people were more likely to make a public video about personal issues and put it online that to open up in person, which makes sense, because in a way you are still anonymous in that situation. Odds are that no one who sees the video will know you or anyone you know and therefore don’t feel “real.”</p>
                    <p>From Hunter Montgomery’s article on online communities, I learned that private online communities differ from public social networks. In normal online social networks, people view the platform as casual and merely spend time there for entertainment purposes. However, in private online communities, people often invest their time. This means that they are there to actively grow as people and get some lasting value out of the interactions. The article is geared more towards companies and how to improve customer experience and loyalty, but I think that this information is very useful for my purposes as well. He says, specifically, that regardless of the type of online community, they always function best when they are easy, intuitive, secure, and make sense. Since my idea for my site is much closer to a private online community, I’d like to try to foster this type of perception in order to make the biggest positive impact on users as possible.</p>
