        <h1>Interaction Design Comparative Research</h1>
        <h2>College Scorecard</h2>
        <div class="holder"><img src="images/college.png" title="collegescorecard.ed.gov screen capture"></div>
        <p>The college scorecard, a government-run website that helps people/families learn details and statistics about American colleges, uses a comprehensive search feature to find and narrow down colleges for prospective students. On the left side of the page after the user makes an initial search, there is a filter window that allows customization of many different parameters. At the top is the original search, and below that is a location dropdown. All of the dropdowns in this filter box open a list upon being clicked. The user can then either scroll through the options, or type in the box to search, making it very user friendly. There are also subtle mouseover changes on every clickable element, making interaction very clear and inviting. This makes sense, because this website was specifically designed to shed light on facts that many families are not aware of, and all of the information on the site needs to be as obvious and clear as possible. There are many different filters that can be applied, including sliders and checkboxes that are very intuitive. Contrasting colors make interactive elements pop out from the rest of the page and invite interaction. Outside of the filter box, colleges are listed as cards that give a summary view of the colleges statistics, prompting the user to click for more information. There are also easily recognizable buttons for sorting and clearing the search. This site is intended for all citizens of the USA, but it is most useful for low income families that are less likely to be informed about true college prices and college affordability. I think that it does very well at what it intends to do.</p>
        <h2>Career Explorer</h2>
        <div class="holder"><img src="images/career.png" title="careerexplorer.com screen capture"></div>
        <p>Career explorer is a website designed to help people learn more about their preferences, personalities, and career prospects. It puts users through a few tests, then uses the results to recommend careers the user would likely enjoy or find fulfilling. In addition to this information, it also provides breakdowns of working styles and personality types. The quiz itself is comprised of questions requiring users to choose between five options, usually ranging from either “Love it” to “Hate it,” or “Very much agree” to “Very much disagree.” When the user mouses over each option, it is highlighted very clearly so as to make sure that the user knows which answer they are choosing. After answering a good amount of questions, small pop-ups will appear at the bottom of the screen which, when clicked, bring up small modal windows describing some unique personality trait that the user possesses based on their answers. If not clicked for a few seconds, this pop-up will wiggle a bit to get the user’s attention. If left alone still, it will disappear back off of the page. Based on the site’s visual design, general layout, and interaction, it appears to be geared toward people who already have some sort of education, perhaps high schoolers, college students, or people looking to change careers. The whole site has a sort of “silicon valley” vibe.</p>
        <h2>Comparison</h2>
        <p>These two sites are very different in terms of purpose, style, and execution. However, their general aim is quite similar: to inform and help people make the best possible decisions about their futures. They actually work very well in conjunction for someone looking to enter or re-enter college, as one helps the user find out what they want to study, and the other helps the user find out where to best study it based on their needs. Their interactions are basically unrelated to each other, but a common element is very obvious roll-over animations/highlights. These subtle changes on mouseover do a lot to improve clarity and interaction for users.</p>
